### Hi there üëã

#### Interesting projects
I migrated my old Technet Script Center [PowerShell] Scripts to here [msdn-scriptcenter-repo](https://brwilkinson.github.io/msdn-scriptcenter-repo/)

Azure Deployment Framework (ADF) docs here [AzureDeploymentFramework](https://brwilkinson.github.io/AzureDeploymentFramework/)
- Note this is now a `Bicep` üí™üèº project and the ARM templates are archive to `armjson` branch
- Note the previous main branch was moved to `ADFv2` branch, new code is in `main` which is V3 code (March 2023)
  - This is an updated version of this Framework
