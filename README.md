### Hi there 👋

#### Interesting projects
I migrated my old Technet Script Center [PowerShell] Scripts to here [msdn-scriptcenter-repo](https://brwilkinson.github.io/msdn-scriptcenter-repo/)

Azure Deployment Framework (ADF) docs here [AzureDeploymentFramework](https://brwilkinson.github.io/AzureDeploymentFramework/)
- Note this is now a `Bicep` 💪🏼 project and the ARM templates will be archived soon.

- Sample project 'built from' the `AzureDeploymentFramework` [microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-comms-samples/Teams EchoBot](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-comms-samples/tree/master/Samples/PublicSamples/EchoBot)
